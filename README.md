# Reliable-UDP-based-HTTP-communication-stack
This project implements a Reliable UDP-based HTTP communication stack, simulating TCP-like reliability features (stop-and-wait and Go-Back-N) over unreliable UDP. It includes a client-server architecture, HTTP request handling, and a TCP-to-UDP proxy for testing with web browsers.
